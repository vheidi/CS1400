Input the # of items you want to check out from the Line, has to be a non negative natural number  

if you input something other than a positive natural number, the program returns an error exception stating you must input a valid command in order for the program to function

Input the Grocery Item and the price for the item.

Once you exit, the code prints out everything you input and the price for each input to the 2nd decimal place.

Some errors we had and currently still have is during the phase where you need to type in the items that you are trying to buy, for example, eggs, you can still add a number there even after we tried using nextLine() instead of just next().
